// Frontend (Client-Side) - socket.emit:
// Context: In the frontend, socket represents the WebSocket connection specific to the current client (user).
// Usage:
// When you use socket.emit in the frontend, you're sending an event or data from this specific client to the server.
// Since each client has its own unique socket connection, using socket.emit ensures that the event is emitted only from this particular client.
// Backend (Server-Side) - io.emit vs socket.emit:
// socket.emit:

// Context: On the server-side, socket represents a single connection with a specific client.
// Usage:
// If you use socket.emit on the server, you're sending a message back to the specific client associated with that socket. This is useful for sending private messages or responses to specific clients.
// io.emit:

// Context: io represents the Socket.IO server instance, which manages all connected clients.
// Usage:
// When you use io.emit, you're broadcasting an event to all connected clients. This is useful when you want to send a message to every client, like updating all users with the current list of online users.

// Why Not io.emit in the Frontend?
// Scope: In the frontend, you don't have an io object like on the server. The frontend only interacts with its specific socket connection, so you use socket.emit to communicate with the server.
// Broadcasting: The io.emit is designed for the server to broadcast messages to all clients. Since the frontend is just one client, it wouldn't make sense to broadcast to all clients from a single client's context.
// Summary:
// Frontend: Use socket.emit to send messages from the specific client to the server.
// Backend: Use socket.emit to send messages to a specific client or io.emit to broadcast messages to all clients.
